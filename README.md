# hotel-auberge
Hotel Auberge is a 2D and 3D point-and-click game demo created as a group project at Maine College of Art. 

This game was made in the 2018 Collaborative Productions (AG 352) class with a small group of other students. This project was created over a semester and intended to be a demo for a potentially larger game. I designed and scripted the UI system outside of Fungus (https://fungusgames.com/), assisted in developing a character controller and camera follow script, and led the process of importing assets and assembling the game.

Since this game was made in 2018 for Mac and not updated since, it might have trouble being run and viewed in Unity on other and/or newer platforms. The gameplay preview of this game can be found here if the issue occurs: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TD21FW3HcuI.
